This is a simple Flask web application that generates random quadratic formulas, provides their answers, and displays a graph.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceSimon/random-quadratic-formula-generator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd random-quadratic-formula-generator`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the application: `python main.py`
5. Open your browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal.
## Usage
Once you have the application running, simply click on the "Generate" button to generate a random quadratic formula. The formula will be displayed with the equation `f(x)= ax^2 + bx + c` format. The application will also display the solutions of the equation, as well as a graph of the quadratic function.
